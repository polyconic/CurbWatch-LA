# CurbWatch LA

Street parking, block by block, from Echo Park to West Hollywood. Search an address or click any block to see its street-sweeping days, whether it's a permit street and when that's enforced, Dodger game-day restrictions, meters, nearby lots, plate-reader cameras, and where tickets actually get written.

## Coverage

Doheny east to the Arts District, Franklin down to roughly Pico. Labeled on the map:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Eastside** | Elysian Park, Angelino Heights, Echo Park, Westlake, Silver Lake, Virgil Village |
| **Central** | Los Feliz, East Hollywood, Koreatown, Hollywood, Larchmont, Hancock Park |
| **West** | Mid-Wilshire, Fairfax, Beverly Grove, West Hollywood |
| **Downtown** | Downtown, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Arts District |

Also inside the covered area, unlabeled: Thai Town, Little Armenia, Historic Filipinotown,
Rampart Village, Melrose, Carthay, Bunker Hill and the Civic Center. West Hollywood is a separate city with its own rules;
it's drawn with a dashed boundary and uses the city's own permit and sweeping schedules.

Beverly Hills falls inside the map's frame but outside its coverage — it publishes none of
this data, so it's grayed out and a click there says so rather than implying the curb is free.

## Running it

Static site: `index.html` plus a data snapshot in `curb-data.js`. No build step to view it.

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

then open http://localhost:8000.

## Refreshing the data

```
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python tools/fetch.py    # downloads everything into data/raw/ (a few minutes)
.venv/bin/python tools/build.py    # writes curb-data.js
```

City data isn't the curb. Red curbs, hydrants, driveways and temporary signs aren't mapped, and the posted sign always wins.
